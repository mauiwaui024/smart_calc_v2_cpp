### Description of the project:


This program is a universal calculator that allows users to perform various calculations, including calculating arithmetic expressions, plotting functions, calculating loans and deposits.

The program provides an intuitive user interface for entering expressions and viewing results.

The calculator offers great flexibility and accuracy, making it suitable for a variety of mathematical calculations.

Users can efficiently evaluate complex arithmetic expressions, visualize function graphs, and make informed financial decisions using the loan calculator mode.

With a user-friendly(to be honest, not so friendly, it does not even have buttons to enter digits lol) interface and accurate results, the program satisfies a wide range of mathematical needs.

### Evaluation of an arithmetic expression:

Users can enter arbitrary arithmetic expressions in square brackets in infix notation using common arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and modulus.

The calculator accurately calculates expressions up to 7 decimal places and can handle expressions up to 255 characters.

It supports math functions such as cosine, sine, tangent, arccosine, arcsine, arctangent, square root, natural logarithm, and decimal logarithm.

### Plotting:

Users can plot functions given in infix notation with the variable "x".

The program provides a convenient coordinate system with applied scales and an adaptive grid.

The user can use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out and drag the image to move around the grid.

The function domain and code domain are limited to -1000000 to 1000000, but the user can specify the display domain and code domain for plotting.

To create a graph image, the user must enter an equation, click the "GRAPH" button and press the "draw" button, or there is also the option to enter in the graph window and output by pressing enter.
